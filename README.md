🌦️ ##Weatherly — Python Weather Application

Weatherly is a Python-based desktop weather application that allows users to search for cities and view current weather conditions and forecasts.

The app stores search history locally and includes a basic admin view for monitoring user activity and logs.

This project was built as part of my Software Engineering learning journey and is intended to demonstrate backend logic, UI integration, API usage, and database handling.
